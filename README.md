Statistical consulting project for Dr. Marisol Lopez â€“ item analysis and test evaluation.

This project analyzes the quality and fairness of multiple-choice questions using item difficulty, point-biserial correlation, discrimination index, and inter-rater reliability. We also explore demographic influences using T-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and DIF analysis.

Conducted by Chang Lu, Qiuyi Feng, and Beiming Yu as part of the BU MSSP consulting practicum (Spring 2025).
